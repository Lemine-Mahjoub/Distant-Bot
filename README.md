## Overview

The **Distant Bot** is designed to enrich user interactions within Discord servers by **facilitating media sharing from popular social platforms directly into Discord channels**.\n\n
By supporting **Instagram Reels**, **TikTok videos**, and **Twitter posts**, Distant not only enhances the user experience and community engagement but also aims to **combat social media addiction**. This innovative approach allows users to stay within Discord, reducing the urge to switch between apps and potentially fall into the social media rabbit hole.\n
A key feature is the ability for users to **like shared videos**, promoting an interactive and engaging community experience.\n
Users can also **share tracks from a music streaming service**. Distant will search and send the links of all platforms for the track.

## Features
