# Overview
The Distant Bot is designed to enrich user interaction within Discord servers by providing a seamless way to share media from popular social platforms directly into Discord channels. It supports Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, and Twitter posts. By utilizing direct links from ddinstagram, vxtiktok, and fxtwitter, the bot bypasses the need for users to leave Discord to view content, enhancing the user experience and engagement within the community.

## Features
- Ping Command: Quickly check if the bot is responsive and operational.
- Share Command: Share media from Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter directly into your Discord server by providing the post's link. The bot processes these links and returns a direct link to the video or post, viewable within Discord.
